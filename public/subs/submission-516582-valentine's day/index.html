            One day a programmer almost broke and desperate walked down the street, he walked looking up at the sky, wondering how he was going to earn money. He hit a <mark class="adjective">pretty__</mark>  young lady ,so <mark class="adjective">pretty__</mark> that for a moment he had forgotten his worries, he asked her name and she told him that her name was <mark class="fname">female name__</mark> and he told her that is name was <mark class="mname">male name__</mark>, meet again? He asked, "you are as <mark class="adjective">pretty__</mark> as a rose gathered in <mark class="place1">a place__</mark>, your eyes could <mark class="verb">verb__</mark> any sick man." She smiled and showed him her beautiful <mark class="color">color__</mark> teeth, then she said, perhaps, and went away. The next day he took the same path, and met her again, offered her an appointment in a <mark class="place2">place__</mark>, which she accepted. He paid with his last savings. After this rendezvous he exclaimed: "This girl is more <mark class="adjective">pretty__</mark> than gold, more <mark class="adjective">pretty__</mark> than a diamond, she deserves to live like a <mark class="animalf">animal female__</mark>. But I can not offer her anything." He took his computer connected to the internet and looked for ways to make money online, and he retired topcorder.com. His first challenge was to create a web application with node.js, angularjs and mongoDB, he won this challenge handily. He received his money on February 13, bought an alliance, and on February 14 he asked his beloved , Would you be my <mark class="animalf">animal female__</mark> and also my valentine forever? And she answered yes my baby. Eric married her <mark class="animalf">animal female__</mark>, and he thanked topcoder.com, he says I love topcoder.com and also the money he makes me win because as you know there is no love without <mark class="thing">thing__</mark>.
